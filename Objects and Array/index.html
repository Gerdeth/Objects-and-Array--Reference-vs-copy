    // however what happens when we update that array?
    rockStars[3]= 'Gee';
    console.log(rockStars);

    console.log(players);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const rockStars2= players.slice();

    const person = {

    // and think we make a copy:

    console.log(person,captain);


    // how do we take a copy instead?

    console.log(person, cap2);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3={...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
